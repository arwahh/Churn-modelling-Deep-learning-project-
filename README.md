## Churn-modelling-Deep-learning-project-
This project predicts customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network. We preprocess data, encode categorical variables, scale features, and train a deep learning model using TensorFlow. The model outputs the probability of customer churn using a sigmoid activation function.
